# Master Thesis: Augmented Foresight - Leveraging AI in Human Strategic Decision-Making

This project stems from my master thesis at the Chair of Strategic Management and Innovation of ETH Zurich. For my thesis, my goal was to identify research and innovation trends to serve as an input for strategic decision-making. To this end, I applied dynamic topic modeling to grant data on research and innovation projects, namely to projects within the European Framework Programme. Analyzing the project descriptions with dynamic topic modeling revealed research and innovation topics on the one hand and up & down-trending words within these topics on the other hand.

This project contains the pipeline I built to 
1. collect the grant data (research and innovation projects),
2. preprocess the project descriptions,
3. apply dynamic topic modeling,
4. extract the results 
5. and transform the results so that they could be analyzed in Power BI.
